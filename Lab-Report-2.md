`/add-message?s=This is the first message`

<br />

1. _The server starts with the StringServer class, where the main function runs on launch. From here, the main function calls the Handler class, which runs the handleRequest function._
2. _The relevant argument for StringServer, specifically its main function, is the port we assign when starting the server. In this case, the port I used was ` 4000 ` . In handleRequest, the relevant argument is the active URL. Specifically, we check if there is either a ` / ` at the end of the URL, which signals us to display the current string list or an argument such as ` /add-message?s=This is the first message ` , which calls for ` This is the first message ` to be added to the ArrayList._
3. _For the main function in StringServer, if we don't specify a valid port, or if we don't provide a port, the program will immediately exit with a message displaying ` Missing port number! Try any number between 1024 to 49151 `. For handleRequest, the values of any arguments are checked for one of three cases:
   - the URL ends with ` / `, in which case the website displays the current list of added messages
   - the URL ends with ` /add-message?s=<string> `, in which case ` <string> ` is appended to the end of the ArrayList Strings
   - no change to the URL, in which case the page stays as it is
   - or an invalid argument, in which case the website displays a ` 404 Not Found! ` message

### Message 2 ###

## In a couple of sentences, describe something you learned from lab in week 2 or 3 that you didnâ€™t know before. ##

_These last two labs in weeks 2 and 3 have been very interesting as I've never done work on remote servers before. Before now, I didn't know the process of opening a terminal and using SSH to access a remote server and do things such as host webpages. This feels like a very useful skill to learn that would be applicable in industry-level programming._
