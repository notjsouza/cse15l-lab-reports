2. _I ran this from /home._
3. _The output shows all the files available in this directory._
4. _There is no error in this output._ <br />

1. `[user@sahara ~]$ cat`
2. _I ran this from /home._
3. _There is no output because cat takes a file and prints it to the terminal. Because no file was specified, there was no output and I needed to end the task with CTRL + C._
