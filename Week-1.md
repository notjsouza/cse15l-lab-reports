1. A screenshot or Markdown code block showing the command and its output
2. What the working directory was when the command was run
3. A sentence or two explaining why you got that output (e.g. what was in the filesystem, what it meant to have no arguments).
4. Indicate whether the output is an error or not, and if it’s an error, explain why it’s an error.
