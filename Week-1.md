## For each of the commands cd, ls, and cat, and using the workspace you created in this lab:
---
**No Args:**
- `[user@sahara ~/lecture1]$ cd` <br />
<br />
_I ran this from /home._ <br />
_There is no output here because I'm not giving any location to cd into. This command needs a destination, or nothing will happen._ <br />
_I don't think this is an error, I think I'm simply not giving any location to go to._ <br />

- `[user@sahara ~/lecture1]$ ls` <br />
  `Hello.class  Hello.java  messages  README` <br />


- `[user@sahara ~]$ cat` <br />

1. A screenshot or Markdown code block showing the command and its output
2. What the working directory was when the command was run
3. A sentence or two explaining why you got that output (e.g. what was in the filesystem, what it meant to have no arguments).
4. Indicate whether the output is an error or not, and if it’s an error, explain why it’s an error.
