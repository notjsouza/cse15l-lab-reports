## For each of the commands cd, ls, and cat, and using the workspace you created in this lab:
---
**No Args:**
- `[user@sahara ~/lecture1]$ cd` <br />
_I ran this from /home._ <br />
_There is no output here because I'm not giving any location to cd into. This command needs a destination, or nothing will happen._ <br />
_I don't think this is an error, I'm simply not giving any location to go to._ <br />

- `[user@sahara ~/lecture1]$ ls` <br />
  `Hello.class  Hello.java  messages  README` <br />
_I ran this from /home._ <br />
_The output shows all the files available in this directory._
_There is no error in this output._

- `[user@sahara ~]$ cat` <br />
_I ran this from /home._ <br />
_I got no output because cat takes a file and prints it to the terminal. I got no output because no file was specified._ <br />
_This is an error because cat requires a file to read from and print an output in order to work properly._ <br />

1. A screenshot or Markdown code block showing the command and its output
2. What the working directory was when the command was run
3. A sentence or two explaining why you got that output (e.g. what was in the filesystem, what it meant to have no arguments).
4. Indicate whether the output is an error or not, and if it’s an error, explain why it’s an error.
